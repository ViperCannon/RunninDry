As you continue down the street, you notice a crowd gathering at a small park. As you drive closer, you see it appears to be some sort of abolitionist rally, with a stage and everything. The speaker is impassioned, but the crowd seems... reluctant. Perhaps this is a good opportunity to speak your mind...

+ [Speak on behalf of the people.]
    You take to the podium, espousing how the Inhibition Act robs the people of Flatiron City- and the United Territories- of their freedoms. The crowd murmurs... [ADD SUCCESS/FAILURE CONDITIONS!]
 
+ [Go after the abolitionists!]
    You start vehemently attacking the opposing speaker and their allies, criticizing their appearance, superficial morals, prudishness, and cold demeanor. The crowd murmurs... [ADD SUCCESS/FAILURE CONDITIONS!]
    
+ [Cause some "mayhem."]
You get on stage and pull out your weapon, firing into the air. The organized crowd becomes a mob in seconds, some scrambling to get away, others moving to intercept you. In the chaos, you're able to grab a few purses (+25 Cash). [-5 Abolitionist and Police Rep, +10 Mob rep, Begin a combat encounter with one civilian, one drunk, and one cop.]
