Ah, a new booze-running gang putting their stakes in the game. The Repetti's, was it? Well, if you're gunnin' for a successful business venture, yer gonna need to learn the ropes. In ol' Flatiron city, it's not just the fuzz, scorchers, and rival gangs ye'll have to worry about. There's also the matter of the locals; be they model citizens, wise guys drunk off their asses, or die-hard abolitionists, some looneys will attack 'ya. I even heard there's some weird abnormities roaming the streets, but that sounds like a load o' rumors t' me.

    Woah, WOAH, slow your roll! Love the enthusiasm, but ye' gotta think smart about this. It ain't worth going in picking every fight you can, or you'll get squashed. Sometimes, you've gotta... "smooth things over" to get what you want. And y'know what? I think I see the perfect opportunity t' practice coming up here.
