EXTERNAL NewNegotiation()

These lil' speech bubbles are Negotiations, and there are 3 ways to negotiate! You could intimidate for a high risk, high reward gamble, talk it out diplomatically, or slip 'em a bribe and be on yer way. Since you're working on the fly though, you'll have limited options to choose from when negotiating for this first run. Give it a shot at the next stop!
