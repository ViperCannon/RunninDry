Ah, a new booze-running gang putting their stakes in this game. The Repetti's was it? Well if you're gonna be making this into a successful business venture, ya gonna need to learn the ropes. Out here in Flat iron city, it's not just cops and rival gangs you'll have to worry about. Theres also the matter of the locals, be they drunks, model citizens, or die-hard abolitionists. I even heard there's some weird abnormities roaming the streets, but they sound like just rumors to me.

    Woah, slow your roll kid. I like the enthusiasm but you gotta think smart about this. Not worth going in picking every fight you can, or you'll get squashed in an instant. Instead sometimes you gotta "smooth things over" to get what you want. Oh wait I think i see the perfect opportunity coming up here. Since you're working on the fly, youll have limited options to choose from when negotiating. There are 3 types of way for negotiating: the high risk, high reward Intimidation style, the middle of the road Diplomacy, and the tried and true Bribery. The last one is gonna cost ya tho.
